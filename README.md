In this study, nickel-based metal alloy structures were selected from the Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) Dataset, constructing the OC20-Ni dataset, which contains 26,745 catalytic structures. All structures are stored in .lmdb format. 
The full OC20 dataset is publicly available at http://opencatalystproject.org.  
The OC20-Ni dataset can be found at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yt4FVOTUYs0S8hmPUjETTzFzZcjfREUs/view?usp=sharing.
